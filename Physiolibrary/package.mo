<td valign=\"middle\"><p><a href=\"modelica://Physiolibrary.Chemical\">Chemical</a></p><p>In physiology books, chapters about chemical substances are organized by their types. The main reason for this is that each substance in the human body is regulated in a different way. For example the regulation of sodium is different from the regulation of potassium, and from the regulation of glucose, and so on. This view leads to the idea of having separate models of each substance. The origin of different flows and regulations is the (cellular) membrane. Water and solutions can cross it in different directions at the same time. Crossings occur for different reasons: water is driven mostly by osmotic gradients, electrolytes are driven by charge to reach Donnan&apos;s equilibrium, and some solutes can even be actively transported against their concentration or electrical gradients. And all this is specifically driven from the higher levels by neural and hormonal responses.&nbsp; </p><p>In Physiolibrary flows and fluxes of solutes are supported mostly by the Chemical package. All parts inside this Chemical package use the connector ChemicalPort, which defines the molar concentration and molar flow/flux rate of one solute. This is the supporting infrastructure for modeling membrane diffusion, accumulations of substances, reversal chemical reactions, Henry&apos;s law of gas solubility, dilution with additional solvent flow, membrane reabsorption, chemical degradation and physiological clearance. </p></td>

<td valign=\"middle\"><p><a href=\"modelica://Physiolibrary.Hydraulic\">Hydraulic</a></p><p>The main usage of the hydraulic domain in human physiology is modeling of the cardio-vascular system. And because there are no extreme thermodynamic conditions, the system can be really simple &mdash;it is only necessary to model conditions for incompressible water, at normal liquid-water temperatures and with relative pressure 5-20kPa. This boring thermodynamic state leads to the very simple blocks of hydraulic resistance, hydrostatic pressure, volumetric flow, inertia and finally the block of blood accumulation in elastic vessels.</p></td>

<td valign=\"middle\"><p><a href=\"modelica://Physiolibrary.Thermal\">Thermal</a></p><p>For the human body to function optimally, it is critical to hold the core temperature at 35&ndash;39&deg;C. A fever of 41&deg;C for more than a short period of time causes brain damage. If the core temperature falls below 10&deg;C, the heart stops. As in the hydraulic domain, the thermal domain is simplified to these conditions. </p><p>In the Thermal package extends the package Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer from Modelica Standard Library 3.2 (MSL), where the connector is composed of temperature and heat flow. The main blocks in Thermal are: Conductor, IdealRadiator and HeatAccumulation. The heat conductor conducts the heat from the source, such us muscles or metabolically active tissue, to its surrounding. IdealRadiator delivers heat to tissues by blood circulation. HeatAccumulation plays a role in accumulating thermal energy in each tissue mass driven by its heat capacity. We recommend to use this block instead of Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer.HeatCapacitor to have possibility of variable mass amount or to have a support for calculation of steady state. </p></td>

<td valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"modelica://Physiolibrary/Resources/Images/UserGuide/Osmotic.png\"/></p></td>
<td valign=\"middle\"><p><a href=\"modelica://Physiolibrary.Osmotic\">Osmotic</a></p><p>One of the basic phenomenon of biological systems is the osmotically-driven flow of water. This is always connected with semipermeable membranes. The different concentrations of impermeable solutes on both sides of the membrane causes the hydrostatic pressure at the concentrated side to rise. This pressure difference is called osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure is linearly proportional to the concentration gradient of impermeable solutes. The osmolarity (osmotic concentration) is also one of the main indexes of human body balance, called homeostasis. Its value should not significantly deviate for a long period of time from a value of 285-295 mosm/l. </p><p>In Physiolibrary the osmotic connector OsmoticPort is composed of the osmotic concentration and the volumetric flux of permeable liquid. The two main blocks are called Membrane and OsmoticCell. Here, inside the membrane blocks, it is of course possible to also define hydraulic pressure and temperatures effects on both sides of membrane. </p></td>

<td valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"modelica://Physiolibrary/Resources/Images/UserGuide/Population.png\"/></p></td>
<td valign=\"middle\"><p><a href=\"modelica://Physiolibrary.Population\">Population</a></p><p>Population models are based on increasing and decreasing of average number of population members. The number of population member is a nonflow variable in connectors and flow variable is the change of population members. The growth or differentiation of cells can be modeled as stream from one population component to another, where each population component could be defined by selected age, type, function or wathever..</p><p>Even the domain is integer, all is modeled by real numbers. </p></td>

<td valign=\"top\"><p><img src=\"modelica://Physiolibrary/Resources/Images/UserGuide/SteadyState.png\"/></p></td>
<td valign=\"middle\"><p><a href=\"modelica://Physiolibrary.SteadyStates\">SteadyStates</a></p><p>One of the main question in clinical medicine is how to stabilize the patient. In the fact of the oscillating heart, breathing, circadian rhythm or menstruation cycle the model could be designed as non-oscillating with variables such as period times, amplitudes, frequencies, mean values and other phase space variables. This type of model has better numerical stability for longer simulation time and even more it can be &QUOT;stabilized&QUOT;. This stabilization we called steady state. </p><p>To be mathematically exact, we define an <i><b>steady state system</b></i> (SSS) as a non-differential system derived from a original differential system (DS) by using zero derivations and by adding <b>additional steady state equations</b> (ASSE). The number of the ASSE must be the same as the number of algebraically dependent equations in the non-differential system derived from DS by setting zero derivations. The ASSE describes the system from the top view mostly such as the equations of mass conservation laws or the boundary equation of environment sources. To define a model as an SSS the user must switch each Simulation parameter in each block to value Types.SimulationType.SteadyState and must have correctly defined all necessary ASSE. This setting caused to ignoring any start values for any state and add zero derivation equations instead. Today does not exist Modelica environment, which could automatically find and remove generated dependent equations by this way. So the correct number of states must be marked as dependent (parameter isDependent) and the same number of ASSE must be inserted. Despite the fact, that model in this steady-state setting will be not locally balanced it should be globally balanced and without any dependent equation.</p><p>Adding of one ASSE is possible by inserting and connecting of the energy or mass conservation law block from package SteadyState.Components. Other possibilities is in blocks of environment&nbsp; sources, where the setting of parameter isIsolatedInSteadyState&nbsp; add the equation of the zero mass/volume/energy flow from or to environment. </p><p>The model in steady state often changes to one big nonlinear strong component, but without solver stiff or convergence problems. Especially in quick chemical reaction kinetics is not necessary to have very rapid molar fluxes, when it always reach equilibrium. This design also approve to create steady stated parts in dynamical model without huge rebuilding. It also&nbsp; brings other benefits. To see these possibilities, one have to realize that conservation laws could be invariances in a dynamical simulation. This is really useful for debugging. </p><p>It is always a big challenge to nicely solve initial values of differential system. However, it should be possible to solve the SSS in initial phase. And this is the idea behind the Types.SimulationTypes.InitSteadyState option for models already extended with ASSE to support SSS. </p></td>

<li>Modelica License 1 is unclear whether the licensed Modelica package can be distributed under a different license. Version 2 explicitly allows that &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; can be distributed under any license of Your choice, see examples in Section 1d) as to what qualifies as Derivative Work (so, version 2 is clearer). </li>
<li>If You modify a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another representation, e.g., a binary representation), you must rename the root-level name of the package for your distribution. In version 1 you could keep the name (so, version 2 is more restrictive). The reason of this restriction is to reduce the risk that Modelica packages are available that have identical names, but different functionality. </li>
<li>Modelica License 1 states that &ldquo;It is not allowed to charge a fee for the original version or a modified version of the software, besides a reasonable fee for distribution and support&rdquo;. Version 2 has a similar intention for all Original Work under <u>Modelica License 2</u> (to remain free of charge and open source) but states this more clearly as &ldquo;No fee, neither as a copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for the copy as such may be charged&rdquo;. Contrary to version 1, Modelica License 2 has no restrictions on fees for Derivative Work that is provided under a different license (so, version 2 is clearer and has fewer restrictions). </li>
<li>Modelica License 2 introduces several useful provisions for the licensee (articles 5, 6, 12), and for the licensor (articles 7, 12, 13, 14) that have no counter part in version 1. </li>
<li>Modelica License 2 can be applied to all type of work, including documents, images and data files, contrary to version 1 that was dedicated for software only (so, version 2 is more general). </li>
</ol></p>
<p><h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) as part of my commercial Modelica modeling and simulation environment?</h4></p>
<p>Yes, according to Section 2c). However, you are not allowed to charge a fee for this part of your environment. Of course, you can charge for your part of the environment. </p>
<p><h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license?</h4></p>
<p>No. The license of an unmodified Modelica package cannot be changed according to Sections 2c) and 2d). This means that you cannot <u>sell</u> copies of it, any distribution has to be free of charge. </p>
<p><h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license when I first encrypt the package?</h4></p>
<p>No. Merely encrypting a package does not qualify for Derivative Work and therefore the encrypted package has to stay under Modelica License 2. </p>
<p><h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license when I first add classes to the package?</h4></p>
<p>No. The package itself remains unmodified, i.e., it is Original Work, and therefore the license for this part must remain under Modelica License 2. The newly added classes can be, however, under a different license. </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) and include it <u>unmodified</u> in a Modelica package under a <u>commercial/proprietary license</u>?</b></p>
<p>No, according to article 2c). However, you can include model, block, function, package, record and connector classes in your Modelica package under <u>Modelica License 2</u>. This means that your Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more classes of it are under Modelica License 2.</p>
<p>Note, a &ldquo;type&rdquo; class (e.g., type Angle = Real(unit=&rdquo;rad&rdquo;)) can be copied and included unmodified under a commercial/proprietary license (for details, see the next question). </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a type class or <u>part</u> of a model, block, function, record, connector class, out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) and include it modified or unmodified in a Modelica package under a <u>commercial/proprietary</u> license</b></p>
<p>Yes, according to article 2d), since this will in the end usually qualify as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a class description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In order to make this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional code in order that the class can be utilized. This is therefore usually Derivative Work and Derivative Work can be provided under a different license. Note, this only holds, if the additional code introduced is sufficient to qualify for Derivative Work. Merely, just copying a class and changing, say, one character in the documentation of this class would be no Derivative Work and therefore the copied code would have to stay under Modelica License 2. </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) and include it in <u>modified </u>form in a <u>commercial/proprietary</u> Modelica package?</b></p>
<p>Yes. If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;, you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g., bug fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under Modelica License 2. This means that your Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more parts of it are under Modelica License 2. </p>
<p><h4>Can I distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; under my commercial/proprietary license, even if classes under Modelica License 2 are included?</h4></p>
<p>Your classes of the &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; can be distributed under your commercial/proprietary license, but the classes under Modelica License 2 must remain under Modelica License 2. This means you can distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo;, but some parts might be under Modelica License 2. </p>
<p><h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) in encrypted form?</h4></p>
<p>Yes. Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of classes (in to unencrypted Modelica source code), you have to send the Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she wishes it, according to article&nbsp;6. </p>
<p><h4>Can I distribute an executable under my commercial/proprietary license, if the model from which the executable is generated uses models from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2?</h4></p>
<p>Yes, according to article 2d), since this is seen as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation of a concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to be simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and by its run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a model can be simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated) and functionality available in the package is removed (e.g., to build up a new model by dragging components of the package is no longer possible with the executable). </p>
<p><h4>Is my modification to a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) a Derivative Work?</h4></p>
<p>It is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as &QUOT;an original work of authorship&QUOT;, a derivative work must be different enough from the original or must contain a substantial amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new version for such purposes. </p>
<p><b></font><font style=\"color: #008000; \">Using or Distributing a Modelica <u>Document</u> under the Modelica License 2</font></b> </p>
<p><font style=\"font-size: 10pt; \">This section is devoted especially for the following applications:</p>
<p>A Modelica tool extracts information out of a Modelica package and presents the result in form of a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; for this package in, e.g., html, doc, or pdf format. </p>
<p>The Modelica language specification is a document defining the Modelica language. It will be licensed under Modelica License 2. </p>
<p>Someone writes a book about the Modelica language and/or Modelica packages and uses information which is available in the Modelica language specification and/or the corresponding Modelica package. </p>
<p><h4>Can I sell a manual that was basically derived by extracting information automatically from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (e.g., a &ldquo;reference guide&rdquo; of the Modelica Standard Library):</h4></p>
<p>Yes. Extracting information from a Modelica package, and providing it in a human readable, suitable format, like html, doc or pdf format, where the content is significantly modified (e.g. tables with interface information are constructed from the declarations of the public variables) qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under alternative 2d). </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2) and use it <u>unmodified</u> in my document (e.g. the Modelica syntax description in the Modelica Specification)?</b></p>
<p>Yes. In case you distribute your document, the copied parts are still under Modelica License 2 and you are not allowed to charge a license fee for this part. You can, of course, charge a fee for the rest of your document. </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2) and use it in <u>modified</u> form in my document?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the creation of Derivative Works is allowed. In case the content is significantly modified this qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under alternative 2d). </p>
<p><h4>Can I sell a printed version of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2), e.g., the Modelica Language Specification?</h4></p>
<p>No, if you are not the copyright-holder, since article 2c) does not allow a selling fee for a (in this case physical) copy. However, mere printing and shipping costs may be recovered.</p>

<p><br/>The origin of this Modelica Physiolibrary was in the first version of our HumMod Golem Edition model implementation, where it was called HumMod.Library. As the successors of Guyton&apos;s Medical Physiology School write, the original HumMod model is &ldquo;The best, most complete, mathematical model of human physiology ever created&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We are also developing many types of smaller physiological models for use in medical education, so it was essential to separate this library from our HumMod Modelica implementation. This separation improves the quality of the next HumMod release and provides a useful Modelica library to modelers in this bioscience.</p>
<p>The library contains only carefully-chosen elementary physiological laws, which are the basis of more complex physiological processes. For example from only two type of blocks (Chemical.ChemicalReaction and Chemical.Substance) it is possible to compose the allosteric transitions or the Michaelis-Menten equation.</p>
<p><br/>Physiology is a very progressive discipline, that examines how the living body works. And it is no surprise that all processes in the human body are driven by physical laws of nature. The great challenge is to marry old empirical experiments with the &ldquo;new&rdquo; physical principles. Many teams and projects in the word deal with this formalization of physiology, for example: Physiome, SBML, EuroPhysiome, VPH, CellML etc. It is our hope that this library helps this unflagging effort of physiologists to exactly describe the processes.</p>
