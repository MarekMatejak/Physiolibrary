{"name":"Physiolibrary","tagline":"Modelica library for Human Physiology","body":"# Physiolibrary\r\n\r\nPhysiolibrary is a free open-source Modelica library designed for modeling human physiology. \r\nThis library contains basic physical laws governing human physiology, usable for cardiovascular circulation,\r\nmetabolic processes, nutrient distribution, thermoregulation, gases transport, electrolyte regulation, \r\nwater distribution, hormonal regulation and pharmacological regulation.\r\n\r\n## Library description\r\n\r\nThe origin of this Modelica Physiolibrary was in the first version of our HumMod Golem Edition model implementation,\r\nwhere it was called HumMod.Library. As the successors of Guyton's Medical Physiology School write, \r\nthe original HumMod model is “The best, most complete, mathematical model of human phys-iology ever created” ( http://hummod.org ).\r\n\r\nWe are also developing many types of smaller physiological models for use in medical education, \r\nso it was essential to separate this library from our HumMod Modelica implementation. This separation improves \r\nthe quality of the next HumMod release and provides a useful Modelica library to modelers in this bioscience.\r\nThe library contains only carefully-chosen elementary physiological laws, which are the basis of more complex physiological\r\nprocesses. For example from only two type of blocks (Chemical.ChemicalReaction and Chemical.Substance) it is \r\npossible to compose the allosteric transitions or the Michaelis-Menten equation.\r\n\r\nLibrary contains also the icons for higher level (HumMod) subsystem implementations:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/MarekMatejak/Physiolibrary/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Current release\r\n\r\nDownload [Physiolibrary 2.0.2 (2014-01-26)](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Physiolibrary/archive/v2.0.2.zip)\r\n\r\n#### Release notes\r\n\r\n*  [Version v2.0.2 (2014-01-26)](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Physiolibrary/archive/v2.0.2.zip)\r\n * Support for steady states calculation by energy/mass conservation laws or enviroment sources\r\n * Conditional inputs for each domain blocks\r\n * Package States renamed to SteadyStates, added SteadyStates.Components\r\n * Removed package Mixed\r\n * Package FileUtilities moved to Types.FileUtilities\r\n\r\n*  [Version v1.2.0 (2014-01-15)](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Physiolibrary/archive/v1.2.0.zip)\r\n * Package structure Physiolibrary.{domain}.[Examples|Components|Sources|Interfaces].{component}\r\n * New icons\r\n * Thermal: Relative heat energy to normal body temperature (37degC) \r\n * New examples: \r\n\tGuyton-Coleman-Granger cardiovascular model, \r\n\tColeman thermal energy transfers\r\n\r\n*  [Version v1.1.0 (2013-12-30)](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Physiolibrary/archive/v1.1.0.zip)\r\n * Heat connector compatibility between Physiolibrary.Thermal package and Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer package (MSL 3.2)\r\n * Some English language corrections\r\n * Hydrostatic pressure patch\r\n * New examples \r\n \r\n*  [Version v1.0.1 (2013-12-11)](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Physiolibrary/archive/v1.0.1.zip)\r\n * The library uses the Modelica Standard Libary (MSL) version 3.2.\r\n * Contains nice physiological icons.\r\n * Support for physiological units: min,kcal,mmHg,ml,mEq,.. \r\n * Base blocks for chemical, hydraulical, osmotic, thermal or mixed domains\r\n * Support of euilibrated systems\r\n * Support for expandable inputs/outputs/tests lists \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis Modelica package is free software and the use is completely at your own risk;\r\nit can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the [Modelica License 2](https://modelica.org/licenses/ModelicaLicense2).\r\n\r\n## Development and contribution\r\nRelease manager: [Marek Matejak](http://www.physiome.cz)\r\n\r\nYou may report bugs or issues to e-mail: marek\\<at\\>matfyz\\<dot\\>cz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"Physiolibrary","note":"Don't delete this file!
